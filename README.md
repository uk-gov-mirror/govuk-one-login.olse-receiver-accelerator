# Integration Testing

Integration tests are located in `tests/vendor/build/aws-lambda/integrationTests/`.

## Prerequisites

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Set required environment variables (see below)
- **You must export and set AWS credentials so the tests can access and hit your AWS stack.**

Set these before running tests:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=access-key-id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret-access-key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=region

# For receiver integration tests
export RECEIVER_ENDPOINT='https://receiver-endpoint'
export RECEIVER_SECRET_ARN='receiver-secret-arn'

# For verification integration tests
export VERIFICATION_ENDPOINT='https://verification-endpoint'
export JWKS_ENDPOINT='https://jwks-endpoint'
export MOCK_TX_SECRET_ARN='mock-tx-secret-arn'

export KMS_KEY_ID='kms-key-id'
export AWS_REGION='eu-west-2'
```

## Running Tests

To run all integration tests:

```sh
npm run test:vendor:build
```

## Configuration

- Vitest config: `vitest.config.ts`

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure correct aws access credentials are set (they rotate)
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Review test logs for errors

## Secret Scanning & Linting
